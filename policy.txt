Privacy Policy for pcAI
Effective Date: 2025-08-25

pcAI values your privacy. This privacy policy explains how your data is handled when you use our app. Spoiler: we don’t collect it. Here's what that really means.

1. No Data Collection
pcAI does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.
Everything happens locally on your device. That means:

 * No user accounts
 * No analytics or tracking
 * No cloud uploads
 * No third-party integrations
 * No data sharing with us or others

Your photos, edits, and exports stay on your device — unless you shared them to others.

2. Offline Processing
All features in pcAI run entirely offline using on-device AI. We never upload your images to any server.

3. Local Storage Only
Your data is only saved:

* Temporarily in memory while using the app
* To your photo library or file system only if you choose to export
* We don’t have access to these files, and they’re never shared unless you do it yourself.

4. No Third-Party SDKs
We do not use advertising SDKs, analytics SDKs, or third-party AI services. No tracking. No fingerprinting. No hidden surprises.

5. Your Rights
Since we don’t collect any data, there’s nothing for you to request, delete, or revoke.
But if you have questions or concerns, we’re happy to answer them.

6. Changes to the Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any significant changes by updating the effective date at the top of this policy. Continued use of pcAI after any modifications signifies acceptance of these changes.

7. Contact Information
